# C++ Snippets

Code snippets of various programming problems written in C++. For Python's version, see [this repo](https://github.com/ntrang086/python_snippets).

## Content
Code is organized by topic.

### Array
Array manipulation such as rotating arrays, etc.

### Graph
Graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, water jug problem, detect cycles, etc.

### Greedy
Greedy algorithms such as Kruskal's min spanning tree, activity selection, etc.

### Linked List
This directory includes code related to linked lists. Examples: Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions), Find the Nth element in a linked list, Remove the Nth element of a linked list; Check if a linked list has cycles; etc.

### Math
Algorithms solving math-related problems: compute factorial, find fibonacci sequences, check primes, etc.

### Search
Include binary search, least/most common elements, etc.

### Sliding window
Solve problems using sliding window techniques such as: find the first m terms of n-nacci numbers, problems related to subarrays, etc.

### Sorting
Sorting algorithms such as: bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort.

### Stack, queue and heap
Algorithms related to stack, queue and heap. Examples: Implement a stack; Implement a queue; etc.

### String
String manipulation problems such as: Find the first non-repeated character in a string; Reverse a string iteratively and recursively; Determine if 2 strings are anagrams; Check if string is a palindrom; etc.

### Tree
Tree-related algorithms such as: Implement a binary search tree with insert and delete functions; Print a tree using BFS and DFS; Write a function that determines if a tree is a binary search tree, etc.

## Setup

You need a C/C++ compiler. Recommended: GNU C/C++ compiler.

## Run

To compile a script file, use:

```bash
g++ myprogram.cpp myprogram

```
To run a program, use:
```bash
./myprogram
```
